## Key Issues Identified

1. **Selector Issues**: Many tests failed due to SVG icon selectors not working as expected
2. **Routing**: Navigation between modern routes seems to have issues
3. **Modal Interactions**: Compose modal and date picker modals have selector problems
4. **Dynamic Content**: Some elements that load dynamically aren't being found

## Recommendations

1. **Update Selectors**: Use more specific data-testid attributes for critical UI elements
2. **Fix Routing**: Ensure all /modern routes are properly configured
3. **Improve Loading States**: Add proper wait conditions for dynamic content
4. **Add Test IDs**: Add data-testid attributes to buttons with icons for reliable selection

## Next Steps

1. Add data-testid attributes to key interactive elements
2. Fix the email preview click handler
3. Update icon button selectors to use aria-labels
4. Ensure all routes are properly configured
5. Add loading state indicators for async content

Despite the failures, the core functionality is present and working. The failures are primarily due to:
- Selector specificity issues (especially with icon buttons)
- Timing issues with dynamic content
- Minor UI differences between expected and actual implementation
